# General

- Size adjustment for num buckets and num columns
- Render vertex density
- Horizontal overlap param
- Column update divider

- Fallback to webgl1

- Export/Import profile
- Save profiles using custom names
- Reset to default profile
- DblClk exit fullscreen
- Enable menu in fullscreen?

- Import audio from youtube/soundcloud/spotify

- Publish to web
  - Include links to my github / email / advertize LED versions
- Different modes
  - Flow from top/bottom/left/right (symmetric and non-symmetric), maybe 3D
  - Columns originate from circle, either going in or out. Include some 3D depth
- Zoom via scroll
- Server to save profiles with voting

# PPS

- MOAR PARTICLES
- bug on seed for large N they arent spread out
- reset/reseed button or mechanism
- maybe add particles via clicking

- Save config to localState on every change

- Scroll to zoom
- Overall scale for to keep param proportions
- physics to push around wiht mouse

- webrtc to share
- connect / expand with local microverses
- pause / frame rate control (+ super sampling)

- add randomness / entropy

- save configs into URL / tokens

- gradient palette

  - maybe scale it dynamically

- can have different rules for each particle and evolve them over time to maximize / minimize
  some prefered density, or individual particles could live and die based on some criteria

- is it possible to train the system to reach some desired behavior??
  - can particles making it through a maze?
